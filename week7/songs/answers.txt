If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

The obvious way to characterize their audio aura is by looking at the average energy, valence, and danceability of a person’s top 100 songs from the past year.

Average energy = 0.65906
Average valence = 0.484443
Average danceability = 0.71646

Based on the high average energy and danceability, the listener's audio aura is best characterized by Orange - Oranges are the rebellious and bold type. They share a need for high-energy, confidence-boosting sounds.

Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

Relying just on average energy, valence, and danceability is likely to miss the full picture of a listener's musical taste, so a better approach would involve looking at genres, moods that the user is listening to and getting personal insights from the user themselves.
