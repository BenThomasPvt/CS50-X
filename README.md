# 🧠 CS50 X – Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science

Welcome! This repository contains all of my coursework, projects, and problem sets completed as part of [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x), Harvard University's Introduction to Computer Science. This rigorous course builds strong foundations in computer science and programming using C, Python, algorithms, data structures, and web development.
