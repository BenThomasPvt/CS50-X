# 🧠 CS50 X – Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science

Welcome! This repository contains all of my coursework, projects, and problem sets completed as part of [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x), Harvard University's Introduction to Computer Science. This rigorous course builds strong foundations in computer science and programming using C, Python, algorithms, data structures, and web development.

## 📘 Course Overview

CS50x covers the following topics in-depth:

- ✅ C Programming (memory, pointers, data types)
- ✅ Algorithms (search, sort, recursion, time complexity)
- ✅ Data Structures (arrays, linked lists, hash tables, tries)
- ✅ Memory Management (malloc, free, valgrind)
- ✅ Python Programming (basics + final project)
- ✅ SQL and Web Development (HTML, CSS, Flask)
