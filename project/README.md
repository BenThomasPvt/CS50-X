#### Description:

Overview
BIRTHDAYS IMPROVED is a web-based application designed to simplify and enhance the process of celebrating birthdays. Inspired by the Week 9 problem sets from the coursework, this application leverages concepts from both finance and birthday management to offer a user-friendly platform for managing and tracking birthday celebrations. With features such as user registration, login, and real-time countdowns, this application ensures that users are always prepared for upcoming birthdays and can celebrate their loved ones’ special days effortlessly.

Features
The application provides several key functionalities. Users can easily register and log in through a straightforward interface. Once logged in, they can add and store birthday information for friends and family. This centralized system makes it simple to keep track of important dates and plan for each celebration.

The app presents a clear view of upcoming birthdays with a countdown indicating the number of days remaining until each celebration. The standout feature is the real-time countdown timer for the next upcoming birthday, which dynamically updates to provide the exact number of days left. This ensures that users are always aware of imminent birthdays and can make timely preparations.

File Structure
The project is organized into several essential files and templates:

app.py: The main Python file using Flask to handle the core functionality of the application, including user authentication, birthday management, and rendering HTML templates.
helpers.py: Contains utility functions and helper methods used throughout the application to streamline common tasks and operations.
layout.html: A template based on the Week 9 problem set 'finance,' which defines the overall structure and layout of the web pages.
register.html: A registration page template based on Week 9 'finance' problem set, allowing new users to create an account.
login.html: A login page template from the Week 9 'finance' problem set, enabling users to access their accounts.
index.html: A page based on the 'birthdays' problem set from Week 9, where users can view and manage their list of birthdays.
styles.css: Contains the CSS styles for the application, ensuring a visually appealing and consistent design across all pages. This file is also based on the Week 9 problem set 'finance.'
Design Choices
The design choices for BIRTHDAYS IMPROVED are influenced by the Week 9 problem sets. The layout.html and styles.css files were adapted from the 'finance' problem set to maintain a familiar and coherent look and feel. This approach not only ensures consistency but also leverages proven design patterns to enhance user experience.

The index.html page is inspired by the 'birthdays' problem set, tailored to present the upcoming birthdays and countdown features effectively. The decision to use Flask as the web framework and run the application with flask run was made to provide a robust and straightforward setup for managing the application’s backend operations.
